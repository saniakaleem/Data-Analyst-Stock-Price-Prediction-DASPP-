## 📝 Project Description

**DASPP (Data Analyst & Stock Price Prediction)** is a research and development-based final year project designed to provide deep insights into the financial stock market using data analytics and predictive modeling.

The primary objective of this project is to help investors and analysts make informed decisions by visualizing and predicting stock price movements. By using machine learning algorithms and historical data, the system attempts to forecast future stock trends. 

The project combines data science tools for preprocessing, visualization, and analysis, along with predictive models that can learn from trends and patterns in financial time-series data.

This solution is particularly valuable in today's data-driven financial environment where decision-making heavily relies on accurate forecasting and historical behavior analysis.
